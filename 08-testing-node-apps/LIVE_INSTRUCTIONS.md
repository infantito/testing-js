This workshop is part of the series of self-paced workshops on
[TestingJavaScript.com](https://testingjavascript.com). This document explains a
few things you'll need to know if you're attending a live version of this
workshop.

## Pre-Workshop Instructions/Requirements

Please watch the
[Setup and Logistics for KCD Workshops](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-setup-and-logistics-for-kcd-workshops)
(~24 minutes). If you follow along with this repo, you should be all set up by
the end of it and you'll be ready to go.

**NOTE: I will assume you know how to work through the exercises.** There will
be _no time_ given for troubleshooting setup issues or answering questions about
exercise logistics.

Here are the basic things you need to make sure you do:

- [ ] Ensure you satisfy all the "Prerequisites" and "System Requirements" found
      in the `README.md`.
- [ ] Run the project setup as documented in the `README.md` (~5 minutes)

If our workshop is remote via Zoom:

- [ ] Install and setup [Zoom](https://zoom.us) on the computer you will be
      using (~5 minutes)
- [ ] Watch
      [Use Zoom for KCD Workshops](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-use-zoom-for-kcd-workshops)
      (~8 minutes).
