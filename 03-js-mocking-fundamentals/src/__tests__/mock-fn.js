/**
 * Often when writing JavaScript tests and mocking
 * dependencies, youâ€™ll want to verify that the function
 * was called correctly. That requires keeping track of
 * how often the function was called and what arguments
 * it was called with. That way we can make assertions
 * on how many times it was called and ensure it was
 * called with the right arguments.
 *
 * Task: use jest assertions to check
 *      1. how often the function is called
 *      2. the function is called with the right arguments
 *
 * Execute: Use `npx jest --watch src/__tests__/mock-fn.js` to watch the test
